## Flavours of Raspberry 2.0 Description


**Flavours of Raspberry 2.0** is an updated 2017 version of our super fun and hands-on 2016 meetup [Flavours of Raspberry - An Exploration of Operating Systems](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Raspberry-Pi-Users-Group/events/228954886/) during which we sampled a variety of operating systems/use cases available to the tiny $30 computer
- OpenWRT
- RetroPie
- OpenELEC
- Raspbian

With the recent release of [Raspbian Pixel Operating System](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/pixel-pc-mac/ "Meetup Description") for Mac and PCs, it is the perfect time to revisit. We will be talking about popular Operating Systems we know and love as well as exploring some updated/new stuffs:

- [Pixel](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ "Pixel download from Raspi Foundation")
- [Retropie](https://retropie.org.uk/ "Retropie website")
- [OSMC](https://osmc.tv/ "OSMC website")
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu-mate.org/raspberry-pi/ "ubuntu-mate on Raspi")
- [Plan 9](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/wiki/plan9/Raspberry_Pi/index.html "plan9 raspi wiki")

**TL;DR** retro video games, several operating systems/projects for the Pi.
